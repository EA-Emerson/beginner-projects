element selector
{

property:value;

}
 Form css to work in our html document, we have embed it into the html code.
there are three ways we can do this.

1. Inline styling.
2. Internal styling.
3. external styling.

inline styling requires that the styling code(css code) be written inside
tag of the element's tag. It usually follows this format: 
<p style="width:50px; height:50px; color:red;"></p>
(style="width:50px; height:50px; color:red;") there is the syntax for inline 
styling..............


internal styling requires that all the css codes be written inside a style
tag. and the syntax for this is just like the normal css syntax:
element selector
{

property:value;

}


External styling: this requires that you open another document with the .css
extension, write all your css codes there and link it(them) to the intended 
html doc with the help of a link tag. note that this link tag is different from
the anchor tag.
<link rel= "stylesheet" href="location/name of the css file.css">
the link tag is usually placed inside the head tag of the html doc.

Box model of css
these implies that every element or tag in html code is actually in the form 
of a box, having these basic properties: margin, border, padding, content.
these are the basic properties of css.
each of these properties stands as parent property to other; for instance
the margin property has under it other properties like margin-left, margin-right
margin-up and margin-down.
the same applies to the rest of them except the contents.
class work.
